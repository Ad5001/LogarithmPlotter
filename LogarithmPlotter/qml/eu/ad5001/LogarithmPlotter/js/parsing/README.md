# General information

Here lies the potential new, abandoned, cleaner implementation of the parsing system that was supposed to replace expr-eval.js, but never came to be because it's unfinished. If somebody has the will to finish this, you're welcome to try, as I won't.

Currently, the tokenizer is complete in use to provide tokens for the syntax highlighting, and the reference to provide usage.
