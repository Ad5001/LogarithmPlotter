## Build & Run

First, you'll need to install all the required dependencies:

- [Python 3](https://python.org) with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), setup a virtual environment, go to the `runtime-pyside6` directory, and call
  `poetry install`.
- [npm](https://npmjs.com) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)), go to the `common` directory, and run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).

You can simply run LogarithmPlotter using `python3 run.py`. It automatically compiles the language files (requires
`pyside6-lrelease` to be installed and in path), and the JavaScript modules.

If you do not wish do recompile the files again on every run, you can use the build script (`scripts/build.sh`) and run
`python3 build/runtime-pyside6/LogarithmPlotter/logarithmplotter.py`.

In order to test translations, you can use the `--lang=<lang code>` commandline option to force the locale.

## Install

### Generate installers:

All scripts noted here can be found in the `scripts` directory.

You can generate installers for LogarithmPlotter after installing all the dependencies.

- Windows installer (crosscompiling from Linux):
    - Run  `build-wine.sh` (requires wine) to build an exe for LogarithmPlotter in build/runtime-pyside6/dist.
    - You also need [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) (the [nsis](https://pkgs.org/download/nsis) package is available on linux).
    - Run the `package-wine.sh` script. You will find a logarithmplotter-setup.exe installer in the build/runtime-pyside6/dist/logarithmplotter/ folder.
- MacOS Archive creator installer:
    - Run the `build-macosx.sh` script to build an .app for LogarithmPlotter which can be found in the build/runtime-pyside6/dist directory.
    - Run the `package-macosx.sh` script. You will find a LogarithmPlotter-v&lt;version&gt;-setup.dmg installer in the
      build/runtime-pyside6/build/pysdist/ folder.
- Linux packages:
    - Run `package-deb.sh`. It will create an DSC and a DEB in build/runtime-pyside6/deb_dist/
    - Run `scripts/build.sh` followed by `snapcraft`. It .snap file in the root directory.
    - See [the flatpak repo](https://github.com/Ad5001/eu.ad5001.LogarithmPlotter) for instrutions on how to build the flatpak.
